        In most cases, Access uses Text Box controls to display Short Text or Long Text fields. However, when you add a Long Text field to a view in an Access web app, Access creates a Multiline Textbox. When using a Multiline Textbox in the browser, you can press Enter to move to a new line in the textbox. If you’re in a datasheet, you’ll need to use the scrollbars to see anything below the first line.
